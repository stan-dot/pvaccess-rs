# pvaccess-rs


Latest implementation is in `easy-pv`. To run the server `cd easy-pv` and `cargo run --bin easy-pv-server`. 
Then to start a client run in a new terminal in the `easy-pv` dir the command `cargo run --bin easy-pv-client`.
`pvaccess` folder is for learning purposes, a messagepack based implementation is there.

To see how many commits on which day run:

```sh

    // Wait for 20 seconds
    sleep(Duration::from_secs(20)).await;

    println!("ðŸ›‘ Time's up, terminating test...");

    // Let tasks shut down gracefully (theyâ€™ll auto-drop)
    c1.abort();
    c2.abort();

    println!("âœ… Two-client test completed.");

```
